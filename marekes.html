    <h1>Marek's disease</h1>
   <p> Marek's disease is<b> a highly contagious viral infection </b>that poses a significant threat to chickens, turkeys, and quails.
     This disease is caused by
     the Marek's disease virus (MDV), a member of the<i><b>herpesvirus family</b></i> .</p>

<h2>Symptoms:</h2>

<p>- Paralysis affecting the wings, legs, or neck.</p>
<p> -Tumors that may develop in the eyes, feather follicles, or internal organs.</p>
<p>-A marked decline in spirits, often resulting in depression, lethargy, and weight loss.</p>
<p>- Eye lesions that lead to vision impairment</li>
<p>-Anemia, noticeable by pale combs, and dehydration, indicated by shrunken combs.</p>
<p>- Diarrhea that can further complicate the bird's health.</p>

<p>Understanding these symptoms is crucial for timely intervention, ensuring the welfare of our feathered friends.</p>
<h2>Transmission</h2>

    <p>- Marek's disease spreads primarily through direct contact, including aerosols and secretions exchanged between birds. </p> 
        <p> -It can also be transmitted indirectly through contaminated materials.  </p>
            <p> -Additionally, the virus can hitch a ride on contaminated shoes, clothing, and equipment, making vigilance essential.  </p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

    <p> -To safeguard your flock, vaccinate day-old chicks before they come into contact with the virus.  </p>
        <p> -Always procure your birds from reputable commercial sources that ensure thorough vaccination.  </p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

    <p> -Unfortunately, there is no cure for Marek's disease.  </p>
        <p>- It is crucial to promptly remove any diseased birds from the flock and ensure they are humanely 
            euthanized to protect the health of the others.</p>  

<h2>Impact</h2> 

    <p>-Marek's disease represents a significant threat to the health and welfare of poultry.  </p>
        <p>-The economic burden of this disease on the poultry industry is staggering, with annual costs estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion. </p>
