    <p class="containa">Poultry farming refers to the practice of raising domesticated birds for the purpose of food production, specifically for their meat and eggs, as well as for their feathers.
         The species most commonly cultivated in poultry farming include chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese.</p>
         <h5>Here are some important considerations when starting a poultry farm:</h5>
     
           <h4>Land and Housing:</h4> 
              <p> Find a suitable piece of land and construct housing that protects the birds from predators and
                 adverse weather conditions.</p>
            
            <h4> Chicks:</h4>  
               Acquire day-old chicks from reputable hatcheries to ensure high survival rates and productivity.
            
            <h4> Feeding</h4>

                Commercial poultry feeding is a science that ensures birds receive the right amounts of
                 energy, protein, and minerals necessary for their growth and production. 
                
                <h4> Types of Poultry</h4>
               
               <p>Chickens raised for egg production are known as layers, while those raised for meat
                 are referred to as broilers. Broilers are generally considered more profitable than layers
                  and require a lower initial investment. </p>
